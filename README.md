# droneUsingEsp32

I always thought of making your own customizable drone is a hard and cumbersome process and i still believe in that but can we make some alternative to that of high end drone to some mini programmable drone that can help kids mostly (STEM) to know more about the drones and how they actually work in easier way. In this project we tried to makeÂ a simple mini programmable drone using esp32 that can be controlled from anywhere around the world. Couldn't complete the project because of unavailabilty of flight controller in India.
